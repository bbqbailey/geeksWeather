This is a weather display that utilizes the Wunderground API for weather.

The API requires a 'key', which can be obtained from Wunderground.

This code does not supply a 'key'.  Instead, it expects to find a 'key' in a seperate file, called 'key.txt'.  The format of the key.txt file is (note - the key referenced is not a valide key, but is the correct format for a valid key):
	{
		comment:"Wunderground Key",
		keyValue:"1do2d656db212dcc",
		state:"GA",
		city:"Alpharetta",
		station:"KGAALPHA23.json"
	}
		

Rev-0: 12/8/15 This code has not yet been developed to a point where it should be utilized.
